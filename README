GENERAL
=======
libgpucrypto is subset of SSLShader software that implements
few cryptographic algorithms: AES, SHA1, RSA using CUDA.
This code is distributed under BSD-style license.
Read LICENSE for more details.

It requires CUDA 1.2 or above capable devices.
We have tested our code on GTX285, GTX480, and GTX580.

Below is the machine specification we used for the test.

CPU: Intel X5650 2.66Ghz x 2
M/B: Super Micro X8DAH
RAM: DDR3 4GB x 6

libgpucrypto is developed under Linux environment,
and it is dependent on CUDA and OpenSSL.
We have tesed our code on CUDA 3.2 and 4.0
along with OpenSSL 1.0.0 (Mar 29, 2010).
Below, we list versions of software that we have tested.

* CUDA 4.0
CUDA driver  : 270.41.19
CUDA toolkit : 4.0.17
CUDA SDK     : 4.0.17

* CUDA 3.2
CUDA driver  : 260.19.26
CUDA toolkit : 3.2.16
CUDA SDK     : 3.2.16

* O/S
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64bit

We never tested our code on other Linux distributions nor 32 bit systems.
Please do not ask for help on distribution specific issues.


SETUP
=====

1) install required libraries
 you can download CUDA stuff at
 http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-40

2) install OpenSSL libraries and headers
 you can download OpenSSL at
 http://openssl.org/source/

3) configure following variables in Makefile.in
 OPENSSL_DIR
 CUDA_TOOLKIT_DIR
 CUDA_SDK_DIR

if you're using system default opeenssl development library,
then you can leave it as blank.

4) build libgpucrypto
 make

5) try running test code

examples)
#./bin/aes_test -m ENC
#./bin/rsa_test -m MP
#./bin/sha_test

you can see more detailed usage by running program w/o arguments or w/ incorrect one :).


HOW TO USE
==========
Please see test folder for example codes that uses libgpucrypto.
Using this code requires some prior knowledge on CUDA programming and
GPU codes are written in a way to optimize performance rather than usability,
and the data structure it's API receives is quite complex to document.
Please see below functions and codes for how to use GPU library.

RSA: rsa_test.cc: test_latency_rsa
AES: aes_test.cc: test_latency_ase_cbc_encrypt, test_latency_aes_cbc_decrypt
SHA1: sha_test.cc: test_latency_hmac_sha1

AES and SHA1 test codes have a function to transform
somewhat human friendly data structure to GPU code's structure.
See aes_cbc_encrypt_prepare, aes_cbc_decrypt_prepare, and hmac_sha1_prepare
to better understand the exact data structure used for GPU code.


NOTE
====
* Support for multi-threaded applications
Sharing a device context between threads does not work
CUDA 3.2 or earlier versions.
CUDA 4.0 supports sharing GPU context among multiple threads,
but we have not tested this capability with our code.

* 64-bit native integer arithmetic for RSA
RSA codes exploits 64-bit native integer support in CUDA 2.x devices.
Use of 64-bit native integer or not is decided during build process.
If you have CUDA 2.x device, and our codes does not utilize it correctly,
then you may fix it by modifying IS_FERMI variable in Makefile.in file.

* Alignment issue
AES and SHA1 GPU codes can handle non multiple of 16 bytes data,
however input data should be aligned before passed into GPU.
The current test code that we provide do not deal with it,
and will not work correctly if you try non-multiple of 16 bytes.
